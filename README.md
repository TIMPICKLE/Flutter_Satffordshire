Abstract
This report is about the development of dual-platform mobile applications. For IOS and android. The mobile application fully considers the advantages of mobile applications and has a good interactive experience. This mobile app supports multiple languages, allowing users to learn about traditional Chinese medicines. Provide a new Chinese medicine learning model. Free users from the environmental limitations of personal computers and books.

Background
With the continuous improvement of medical level, people's concept of medical treatment has been transformed from simple disease treatment to the mode of prevention, health care and rehabilitation. Then the traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes the unity of man and nature, which conforms to the modern people's medical concept. For conditioning and prevention of disease, Chinese medicine has been recognized by most countries in the world.
But in western countries, traditional china medicine is still in a marginal position, and there is still a lot of room for improvement in medical practice. Except for Korea and Japan, TCM has not entered the mainstream of the local medical system, and most of them stay in the "self- employed" clinic mode.
In many pharmacies in Europe, we can buy traditional Chinese medicine, but few pharmacies provide proper use. This is thought-provoking. What makes it difficult for traditional china medicine to be promoted to European countries?

Objectives
It is mainly to realize a mobile application with the following functions: classify Chinese medicine, browse Chinese medicine information, search for drugs according to symptoms, make comments on Chinese medicine, and translate in multiple languages.
a) Background Research
• Do some analysis of IOS, Android, Analyze the benefits of different operating systems
• Compare the existing mobile applications on the market and analysis the advantages and disadvantages
• Compare dual platform technology, master the use of flutter framework, Dart language
• Create Gantt chart for mobile application development

b) Analysis
• A paper analyses the technical problems of Dual platform development.
• Analysis user group and determine service orientation.
• List out all the features specifications of the software.

c) Design
• Design reasonable database, from a practical point of view, consider the basic properties of
the object.
• Design a reasonable UI for mobile applications, Design a reasonable interactive experience.

d) Implementation and testing
• Test all aspects of the system and evaluate the project with a balance between technology,
functionality, and user standards
• Test mainstream models to adapt the app to most mobile phone screens
